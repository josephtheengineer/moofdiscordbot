A) Mods are on an invite-only basis. Please refrain from asking to be promoted.
B) Mods know all. If you are kicked or banned by one mod, rest assured EVERY mod will know.
D) Mods have been chosen with great care. We do not consider the opinions or suggestions of non-mods when selecting new mods. Mods know what they are doing, and they read almost everything that gets posted in every channel; very little happens without the mods knowing about it.
E) Mods take action as necessary. If you feel like action should be taken and isn't, privately message a mod but understand they are not required to placate every member and/or request.

If you need any help or have any questions metion a @Moderator! If you want to get a cool color for your username ping a @Moderator  with the color that you want!

Popular List submissions are currently closed. Thanks to everyone for participating!

The dev team is working on remaking the game in a new crossplatform engine. That will be able to run on iOS / Andriod / Windows easily and will be able to have improved graphics.
