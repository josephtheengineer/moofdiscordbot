The dev team is working on remaking the game in a new crossplatform engine. That will be able to run on iOS / Andriod / Windows easily and will be able to have improved graphics.

Please report any issues, bugs and feature requests with Eden: Universe Builder (EDEN v3.0.0 BETA 1) at gitlab.com/EdenProject/Engine/issues

1: Spamming and message flooding can be disruptive and annoying to other users, so please don't do it. 

2: Respect other members.
Refrain from upsetting other users by insult, name calling, denigration, threats, or any form of harassment; there is no reason to act in that manner. If a mod finds your username to be inappropriate you will be asked to change it on this server. 

3: Read the channel topics before posting.
Channel topics can contain useful information or specific rules for the channel.

4: Absolutely no NSFW or illegal content.
No porn, gore, pirated software. Nothing illegal is to be posted here.

5: Server-wide notifications.
everyone and here (as well as any other "all-user" notifications) are not allowed on this server. By default they are disabled. If you have access to these functions, please let a moderator know.

6: Mods/Admin staff policy.
A) Mods are on an invite-only basis. Please refrain from asking to be promoted.
B) Mods know all. If you are kicked or banned by one mod, rest assured EVERY mod will know; there is no point in sending a PM to a mod to "let them know".
C) Mods support the actions of all other mods in the group. If a mod makes a decision or takes action, all other mods will support it.
D) Mods have been chosen with great care. We do not consider the opinions or suggestions of non-mods when selecting new mods. Mods know what they are doing, and they read almost everything that gets posted in every channel; very little happens without the mods knowing about it.
E) Mods take action as necessary. If you feel like action should be taken and isn't, privately message a mod but understand they are not required to placate every member and/or request.
