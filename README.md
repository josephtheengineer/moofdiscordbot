## Style guide

The JavaScript Standard Style is used in the repository:

2 spaces – for indentation
Single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping
No unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs!
No semicolons – It's fine. Really!
Space after keywords, if (condition) { ... }
Space after function name, function name (arg) { ... }
Always use === instead of == – but obj == null is allowed to check null || undefined.
Always handle the node.js err function parameter
