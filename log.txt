Martin | <@364880624441491456> Have you taken a look at your house ?
Dblcut3 | Oh ok i always thought that square was still grass 😄
•••santiago••• | Not yet🙈I have a bunch of work but when I am freshen Ill do it!:)
Martin | Vale!
•••santiago••• | Vengaaa 😃
Martin | 
Martin | Stadium progress!
Martin | Do you think that I should get rid of this iPhone ?
Martin | 
Martin | 
Martin | It obstructs the stadiul
•••santiago••• | Hahahahaha I like you you have an iphone in the middle of it
•••santiago••• | It reminds me once I had like that a giant blender lol
Martin | 😂
•••santiago••• | But I took it out as I basically stripped away that section of highway
claw33 | Haha nice 😂
•••santiago••• | And maybe yes or put it somewhere else
Martin | I don’t want to put it somewhere else because it is the symbol of the entry of the apple store
Martin | But maybe make it way more little ?
•••santiago••• | Oh is there one?
Martin | Yeah
Martin | 
Martin | I will make the iPhone smaller
Enderstripe | Haha nice 😂
Martin | Haha nice 😂
Enderstripe | 
Enderstripe | <@465278664909651968> <@364880624441491456> <@336567873990426636>
ChazyB06 | Haha nice 😂
Martin | I’ll take a look ASAP!
Enderstripe | Lemme know if any of you successfully obtain a red cube
Martin | Sure
Jeremy | I just did.
Jeremy | The one in the ceiling?
Enderstripe | Yep
Enderstripe | Without modifying any blocks
Enderstripe | Breaking, burning placing etc
Jeremy | I was going for the green one but bounced strange.
Jeremy | And then I noticed it up there.
Enderstripe | And you went for it
Jeremy | Yes.
Jeremy | I guess theres a 4th somewhere?
Enderstripe | Yep
Enderstripe | You cant get a green one from the trampoline
Enderstripe | You have to climb it yourself
Jeremy | I got it from the trampoline.
Enderstripe | Interesting
Enderstripe | Anyway can u find the orange one?
Enderstripe | Its kinda obvious when coming into the tunnel
Jeremy | I found a yellow, green, and red one.
Martin | I got the green one, it was easy, now il try Harding for the red one with the trampo
Jeremy | I made the green one harder than it had to be.
Enderstripe | Hint: use the vines
Martin | Ahhhhh
Martin | This is clever
Jeremy | I found all of them.
Enderstripe | Im going to delete the vine picture soon
Martin | Just got the red
Enderstripe | Try to get the yellow (orange) one (i forgot to paint it yellow)
Martin | I just discovered the technique to get it (ramp with lava)
Martin | Or maybe it’s not that
Enderstripe | Its not
Enderstripe | It doesn't work
Enderstripe | Its made for people with health on
Martin | Ah in that case I have to find where do I climb on the leaves to get this block
Martin | Got it !
Martin | I dont see the 4th one, is it hid?
Enderstripe | Yes
Enderstripe | But its obvious when coming into the tunnel
Martin | Okay
Martin | At the entrance of the tunnel?
Enderstripe | Mmhm
Martin | Does that mean yes ?
Enderstripe | Yes
Enderstripe | But you cant get it from the entrance
Enderstripe | You have to get it from the end
Enderstripe | 
Martin | Okay
Martin | Also I have a suggestion for a few place to hide a block, I’ll tell you in pm when I’ll have found this 4th one
Jeremy | That was the hard was figuring how to get to it. I saw it but wasn’t sure how to get to it.
Enderstripe | Lol
Enderstripe | I strive to do that
Martin | What do you mean by end of the tunnel ? The outside part or the part where the other blocks are ?
Enderstripe | The pic i just sent
Martin | Found it!
Enderstripe | Was it hard
Martin | I found it because of chance
Martin | A bit hard
Enderstripe | Good. 😃
Martin | Good job, you are creative lol!
Enderstripe | Anything you want to see on 1'9?
Enderstripe | Itd be a huge update
Enderstripe | So whatever you want to see i hope its a small request
Enderstripe | I'd prob finish it in January lol
Martin | I just got an idea : building the map of my world in game. What do you think ?
Enderstripe | Nah
Enderstripe | Not right now
Enderstripe | When mircoblocks come sure
Martin | But will they come ?
Enderstripe | Idk
Enderstripe | They should've
Jeremy | What can I add to this alleyway to make it look better? Maybe I need to change the sand to something else?
confused2570 | ill ban all you mfs
confused2570 | don’t test me
Nick Art | There are some other issues at thee airport that may be partially my fault 😛
Nick Art | Gotta fix them one day.
Enderstripe | Dont use yellow bricks
Jeremy | I am keeping the yellow.
Jeremy | I like it.
Jeremy | The front of it.
Ari | i asked steve to make exports that work with unreal
Ari | the tools that work with pod/pvr files are still around but the toolchain is out of date these days .. pretty sure steve has the original maya files or whatever and can make new exports
Dblcut3 | Change it to dark grey stone
Dblcut3 | (the sand i mean)
•••santiago••• | Put some boxes 📦
ChazyB06 | Highway !
ChazyB06 | 
ChazyB06 | This south part of DCE is reserved for Eden Universe Building!
Martin | good job!
Martin | omg you just gave me an idea for my world
ChazyB06 | I like build highway before to facilitate futur building
Martin | yeah
ChazyB06 | What idea
Martin | to build another river in my world. this river would surround all the part of the world that was built before universe builder. everything outside it will be built under universe builder
ChazyB06 | Ok you too just give me an idea... a river! ^^
ChazyB06 | I need a river in DC
ChazyB06 | A looooooong river
Martin | yeah!
Martin | Just got an(other) idea : to build another river in my world. this river would surround all the part of the world that was built before universe builder. everything outside it will be built under universe builder
Martin | (thanks <@327964991603081216> lmao)
ChazyB06 | 😍
Jeremy | dark stone looks better. what you make boxes out of?
Enderstripe | Brown steel?
ZestyWheathin | maybe add some recycling bins?
Jeremy | brown steel could look good.
Jeremy | I already have dumpsters. I guess some smaller bins would help too.
ChazyB06 | https://imgur.com/gallery/rZQ5PWu
Jeremy | I have been making the manipulation tool more user friendly, So I don't have to do everything for everyone. 😃 You don't have to edit the code to do the things I do anymore. I am not done yet but I just though I would share.
Martin | Good job ! and it is kind to do that!
sam | <@465278664909651968> That looks really good, is there a way to download?
Jeremy | Not yet, I still need to add a few features.
sam | Ah ok
Enderstripe | On computer or?
Jeremy | Yeah, it only works on a windows pc
Enderstripe | Ah
Martin | if you want someone to beta test it, call me 😄 <@465278664909651968>
Jeremy | Of course 😄
Jeremy | I am getting a bit closer, One thing it won't do is make maps as I am not really sure how to do that right now.
Enderstripe | <@155957661639114752> just curious will you add Edengineering
Enderstripe | Like pistols, lights turning on and off, etc
Enderstripe | I can make a lot of boss fights with that lol
Martin | oh that would be so cool
Martin | text blocks too
Enderstripe | Yeah
Enderstripe | I want but dont want that
Martin | i **really really** want that
Enderstripe | I want that but because i already built By Enderstripe text message i don't want to take that down
Enderstripe | But then i guess i can keep thst up for emphasis
Martin | oh i want that as direction panel for example
Enderstripe | Oh
Enderstripe | Yeah
Enderstripe | Or street names
Martin | yeah
Enderstripe | Only three streets has a name
Enderstripe | In GOE
Martin | or to do quests
Martin | in mb there are no street name (yet)
Martin | there could be a huge potential with text blocks
Enderstripe | Yep
•••santiago••• | Thats really cool I wonder what youll do there
•••santiago••• | I usually make them of wood tile and stair block
•••santiago••• | Brown stell huh! Thats also a good idea!
•••santiago••• | I could use it as well for alleys in Frabanta
ChazyB06 | The new highway acces next aiport and DCE Jail
ChazyB06 | You can try it here and report me problems
•••santiago••• | Wow awesome
Joseph The Engineer | <@!327581941807316992> Thanks ❤
Dblcut3 | great!! I was gonna suggest someone should make a user friendly version
Martin | <@155957661639114752> are you gonn fix this ?
Joseph The Engineer | idk I don't have access to the site ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Martin | ah, who does ?
Dblcut3 | I mean the forums are basically dead at this point
Dblcut3 | Ideally, we should just use this discord. Or if we really need a forums post, the Eden Wiki has a pretty nice forums section still
Jeremy | One issue, I am realizing (thanks to martin) it would make things easier if I could make a map, but I am not sure how to do that.
Martin | yeah, that's right, but maybe the admin of the site could make the advertisement of the discord server
Dblcut3 | I believe the admin is just Ari
Dblcut3 | Actually others have admin rights ( <@327964991603081216> and <@213035306725670913>  i think) but i doubt they could edit the way the captcha works
Dblcut3 | I wish we could send an email to every forums member about joining the discord though... The forums was really active for a while and has a lot of good old builders that were members
Dblcut3 | But in all reality, the forums should just be archived and redirected to the eden wiki forums. I do miss having a place to make official update posts for my world though - discord just isnt great for doing that imo
ChazyB06 | 👍🏼
Martin | and in that discord there are not that much ppl who care about our worlds
Martin | i guess
Ari | the forums are hacked btw
Ari | i fixed it once
Dblcut3 | Omg really 😄
Ari | and then it happened again
Dblcut3 | Define "hacked"
Ari | they have a virus where the first time you visit it from google or something it redirects to an ad website
Dblcut3 | <@336567873990426636> Tbh people do care about some worlds but just not others as much Ive noticed. Id imagine it would be the same way on a forums post though. I do wish Discord had more forums type elements to it though
Jeremy | yeah, I cant even access the site from google
Dblcut3 | <@!327581941807316992> Ah yes it does. I noticed that. But if you use the actual url it doesnt redirect
Martin | yeah that happened to me 15 minutes ago, Ari
Ari | the virus thing finds some security glitch with the forum, then uses it to put a bunch of malicious code in the files
Ari | its kinda neat if it wasn't so annoying
Martin | can the fact that sometimes when i click on a website from google it redirects me to a malicious website be related to eden forum hack ?
Ari | thats the hack
Ari | i don't think it does anything else
Ari | i fixed it one time and i updated the forum software and all that stuff
Ari | and then it got hacked again , and there wasn't any good option because if you change forum software its very difficult to keep posts

Dblcut3 | You should try to include a simple way to convert the world to the winter theme btw
Dblcut3 | Idk if thats possible though
Jeremy | yeah.
Jeremy | I already have that.
Dblcut3 | Oh awesome!
Dblcut3 | Im going to edit the worlds in the wiki nav-bar. Any suggestions on which ones to include? (The current ones are kinda outdated worlds)
Dblcut3 | And instead of having "popular worlds" "staff favorite" ect as the subcategories, should i change it to like "city worlds" "fantasy worlds" "classic worlds" ect?
Ari | woah, interdimension god stumpy

Samara | <@336567873990426636> Actually Gunni is a quick builder. You know I like taking track of Worlds and there progresses
Enderstripe | I am SLOW
Samara | i found the preview worlds of atlantis raising. he took 2 weeks to finish them
Enderstripe | Yeah
Martin | I am very slow
Samara | before that he built highway to hell
Enderstripe | Thats correct
Enderstripe | Wow
Samara | and between that he took a break of two month
Enderstripe | Highway to Hell; how long did he build?
Samara | i dunno, but I assume maybe 2 to 3 weeks aswell
Samara | I mean its a project
Samara | not an entire city
Enderstripe | Ik
Enderstripe | It took me at least 64 hours to build my underground tunnel to the way it is now. 24 hours in first three days
Samara | well maybe your progress is unefficient
Enderstripe | Wym
Samara | if you work on something you probably do it in a way you would need way more time
Enderstripe | Probably
Enderstripe | I'm going to remove a lake in my world and put a jungle there.
Martin | With fly mode it will take so less time
Enderstripe | Yes
Enderstripe | When i was renovating the tunnel (in 1'8) i made a secert tunnel that basically go to the other side fast
Enderstripe | Like really fast
Enderstripe | I needed that bad when i was building it in 1'3
Jeremy | I am figuring out how to make maps, I have been testing using and old eden city version.

Dblcut3 | Hello Edeners! <:moof_icon:484597539383934976> I'm going to be in charge of compiling a list of worlds to add to a new featured list. We are looking for updates to current worlds on the list and new worlds that you believe should be included in the list.
Dblcut3 | Hello Edeners! <:moof_icon:484597539383934976> I'm going to be in charge of compiling a list of worlds to add to a new featured list. We are looking for updates to current worlds on the list and new worlds that you believe should be included in the list.


Again, if your world is already on the list, do not expect us to automatically update it! You will have to re-submit the world here. If you submit a world that is not yours, that is 100% okay and is actually encouraged - so in other words, try to find some good worlds! (preferably newer ones)


To submit your world, please visit http://app.edengame.net/search.html and search your world. You will have to copy and paste your world’s .name and .eden files (your .eden file is always above the .name file). We also ask you to post a screenshot of the uploaded world in game, but this is not required. If you have trouble with this process, please direct message me. 


The deadline for submissions to this featured list update will be November 1, 2018. We are not too strict with criteria, so do not be afraid to submit your world, whether you think it is good or bad.
Dblcut3 | 
Dblcut3 | **Attention** Please visit <#504072417035943939> to submit your world or update to the featured list! More information can be found in the pinned post on that channel!

Dblcut3 | Yep! But just a warning - I will not take another updated version of your world before November 3rd. So make sure you will not release another update before the deadline because the one you just submitted will be the final one I use.

Jeremy | When you guys say you want mountains what are you expecting?
•••santiago••• | Yes you can also do by only dividing line ice block but makig all ice makes it way easier as you dont fall of the ice
•••santiago••• | So the idea in Frabanta now is that you have highways and a few avenues like that to go faster around while secondary streets are like always with center ice block
Dblcut3 | i guess just tall mountains with unique shapes
Dblcut3 | but im sure thats nearly impossible
