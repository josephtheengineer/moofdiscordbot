**==== Roles ====**

**Administrator**
Administrators are people whom control everything in the server. Do not mess with them.

**Moderator**
Moderators are people whom are overseeing the server. They know what they are doing; they read everything in the server and a little may pass by without the mods knowing. Please do not ask to be promoted to a mod. More information about moderator policy above.

**Developer**
Developers are people whom are making a fork version of Eden: World Builder. To get this role, join the dev team.

**Builder**
Builders are people whom are actively building their world.  They will get special perks, they will get their own channel where they can post updates and news about their world.  They will get a special exclusive pink color. You may ping a @Moderator and ask for the role, but you MUST be the owner of a world youâ€™re building.

**Color Roles**
To get a color role, type `t!selfrole get color: (color)`. If a color isn't available, ping a @Moderator and you might get it. Note not all colors are available.

**==== Rules ====**

**1: No spamming.**
Spamming and message flooding is disruptive to other users and the server. Moderators will not hesitate to ban you on first offence.

**2: Respect other members.**
Refrain from upsetting other users by insult, name calling, denigration, threats, or any form of harassment; there is no reason to act in that manner. If a mod finds your username to be inappropriate you will be asked to change it on this server.

**3: Read the channel topics before posting.**
Please chat in the right channels in order to keep the server organized.

**4: No NSFW or illegal content.**
No, porn or pirated software. Nothing illegal is to be posted on any channel.

**5: Mentions**
Use of all-user mentions such as everyone and here are not allowed on this server except for use by admins.

**6: Mods and Admin staff policy.**
a) Mods are on an invite-only basis. Please refrain from asking to be promoted.
b) Mods know all. If you are kicked or banned by one mod, rest assured EVERY mod will know.
c) Mods have been chosen with great care. We do not consider the opinions or suggestions of non-mods when selecting new mods. Mods know what they are doing, and they read almost everything that gets posted in every channel; very little happens without the mods knowing about it.
d) Mods take action as necessary. If you feel like action should be taken and isn't, privately message a mod.

**==== Welcome! ====**

Welcome to the official Discord server for the continuation of Eden - an iOS game that was open sourced by its original creator Ari Ronen in early 2018. Major forks are currently licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 unless otherwise noted.

**^^^ Scroll up for important links and rules ^^^**
Color roles are now enabled! For example just type `t!selfrole get color: blue` to get a blue color! Just replace blue with the color you want. (If your color doesn't exist, message a moderator and they will add it for you!)

If you need some info about Eden, the Eden Wiki has a ton of information on pretty much everything including popular worlds, blocks, creatures, ect. It also needs some editing, so if anyone wants to help, feel free to! edenworldbuilder.wikia.com

The dev team is working on remaking the game in a new crossplatform engine. That will be able to run on iOS / Andriod / Windows easily and will be able to have improved graphics.

Please report any issues, bugs and feature requests with Eden: Universe Builder (EDEN v3.0.0 BETA 1) at gitlab.com/EdenProject/Engine/issues
