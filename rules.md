**==== Welcome! ====**

Welcome to the official Discord server for the continuation of Eden - an iOS game that was open sourced by its original creator Ari Ronen in early 2018. Major forks are currently licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 unless otherwise noted.

**^^^ Scroll up for important links and rules ^^^**
Color roles are now enabled! For example just type `t!selfrole get color: blue` to get a blue color! Just replace blue with the color you want. (If your color doesn't exist, message a moderator and they will add it for you!)

If you need some info about Eden, the Eden Wiki has a ton of information on pretty much everything including popular worlds, blocks, creatures, ect. It also needs some editing, so if anyone wants to help, feel free to! edenworldbuilder.wikia.com

The dev team is working on remaking the game in a new crossplatform engine. That will be able to run on iOS / Andriod / Windows easily and will be able to have improved graphics.

Please report any issues, bugs and feature requests with Eden: Universe Builder (EDEN v3.0.0 BETA 1) at gitlab.com/EdenProject/Engine/issues
